<h2 id="modellingstrategy">Modelling strategy</h2>
<p>The building of a PBPK model is well-described by Kuepfer et al. (<a href="../input/references.md">Kuepfer 2016</a>) The PBPK models are developed with clinical data of healthy adult subjects obtained from the literature, covering available dosing ranges for e.g. intravenous as well as oral administration, to capture both systemic clearance as well gut-wall metabolic clearance processes. Plasma concentrations following multiple-dose application, mass balance information and other clinical measurements need to be included for model development, if available. During model building, uncertainties in data-quality caused inaccurate in vitro assay-techniques regarding mass balance, as well as study differences may cause not being able to adequately describe the PK in adults for all reported studies. </p>
<p>Model performance of the PBPK model for raltegravir are then shown by means of diagnostics plots and predicted versus observed concentration-time profiles, of which the results support an adequate prediction of the PK in adults.</p>
<h2 id="anthropometricandphysiologicalinformation">Anthropometric and Physiological Information</h2>
<p>Regarding the relevant anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published (<a href="../input/references.md">PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3</a>). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim® and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.</p>
<p>The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® are described in the publicly available ‘PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3' (<a href="../input/references.md">Schlender 2016</a>) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.</p>
